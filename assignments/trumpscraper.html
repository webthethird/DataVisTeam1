      <h1>TALLER THAN TRUMP</h1>
      <h3>Final Project Proposal</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="overview">
      <h2>Overview </h2>
      <p class="overview">Taller than Trump will visualize corporate branding of skyscrapers and other large urban structures around the world, using President Donald Trump's prominent global brand as a benchmark for measuring the prevalence and influence of transnational investments of capital in the urban environment. We will use data and imagery collected from SkyscraperPage.com to sort buildings from cities around the world according to the appearance of names of major corporations (Trump has 66 structures in the US, Canada, India, Panama, South Korea, The Philippines, and Turkey). Elevation images of most buildings are available in a standard size and format, which is ideal for visualization. Additional text data such as status, construction dates, floor and unit count, roof and spire heights, building use and description are also available. By comparing other major global brands to the controversial name of Donald Trump, the project seeks to reveal the political and economic forces driving the construction of the built environment, and their effects on skylines around the world.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="audience">
      <h2>Target Audience </h2>
      <p class="audience">Taller than Trump will target both the general public, especially those who have an interest in politics, urban development or globalization, as well as people who work in fields such as architecture, real estate, urban design and planning. Many viewers from a wide range of backgrounds are very concerned about what it means to have a real estate tycoon as President of the United States, and will be curious to see how Trump stacks up against, for example, JP Morgan Chase, or South Korean multinational conglomerate Lotte Group. Anybody who lives in a city will be familiar with the branding of tall buildings, and those with critical or skeptical leanings may be interested in seeing how Trump's prevalence in the US and abroad compares to corporate brands in other countries and cities.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="Overall idea">
      <h2>Overall Idea</h2>
      <p class="overall idea">Since the election of Trump, his brand and corporate holdings have spurred controversy both in the United States and around the world. In the Philippines, where relations are currently strained due to Rodrigo Duerte’s unjustified killings associated with a perceived “drug war”, Trump Tower Manila recently finished construction. In Istanbul, President Erdogan has called for Donald Trump’s name to be removed from his development after the announcement of the “Muslim ban”. Additional controversies have swirled around the incomplete Trump Tower in Azerbaijan and the planned three towers in Rio which have now come to a halt in the pre-construction phase after the election results.</p>
      <p class="overall idea">Not only is Trump’s name controversial because of his demeanor and political views, the nature of his business holdings may have him taking in payments from foreign government. The controversy here is complicated, in one sense the president of the United States is exempt from the “conflict of interest” law as defined under Title 18 Section 208. However, in recent policy, such as which countries made the list and which did not for the Muslim ban, he favored countries where he had business holdings.</p>
      <p class="overall idea">Taller than Trump is about how architecture and urban design intersect with complex political, social and economic conditions across a wide spectrum of geopolitical contexts. It highlights Donald Trump to make a point, both about the cumulative influence of corporate real estate on politics and urban life, and about the relative influence of the President's name compared to other multinational brands.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="Importance of the piece">
      <h2>Importance of the Piece</h2>
      <p class="importance of the piece">The project is important not only because it highlights the global stature of President Trump's corporate persona, but also because it reveals broader trends in real estate investment around the world. While real estate development declined due to the recession in Western markets, regions such as Southeast Asia have experienced booms. Corporate branding of urban space takes on a different nature where neoliberal market forces are non-native and create tensions with conflicting developmental ideologies and urban policies.</p>
      <p>The purpose then of this project is to examine the extent to which politics, finance, and real estate are intertwined. Although sometimes vaguely defined by laws, the influence of money in politics can be seen firsthand in physical form by examining a comparison of influence through skyscraper buildings around the world.</p>

      <h2> Methodology </h2>
      <p> In order to measure Trump’s prominence on transnational investment around the world, we examined the 15 cities in which he has skyscrapers branded with his name. Below are the fifteen cities and the developers/developments which will be compared with Trump.</p>

          </ul>
        </ul>
      <p>From each city we scrapped a dataset from the website skyscraperpage.com. Once the datasets were acquired we used the nltk text sorting tool to look for common words in each of the fifteen cities. Based on the commonly identified words, we determined the top ten most prominent corporations/developers for each city where a Trump tower can be found. After accumulating the top ten developers for each of the respective cities, the goal is to see how they size up against Trump. A portion of the developers examined have one or two buildings in their respective city which are larger than Trump’s developments. Additionally, some of the developments examined contain numerous buildings, which when the floors are aggregated exceed Trump’s prominence.</p>
      <p>Although the methodology with the scrapped data and text sorting is not perfect, it gives a sense of Trump’s relative influence in each city. It shows that for every city examined, with the exception of New York, his developments are being outpaced by numerous other organizations and developers.</p>
