        <h1>TALLER THAN TRUMP</h1>

        <p>Taller than Trump visualizes corporate branding of skyscrapers and other large urban structures around the world, using President Donald Trump's prominent global brand as a benchmark for measuring the prevalence and influence of transnational investments of capital in the urban environment. We used data and imagery collected from SkyscraperPage.com to sort buildings from cities around the world according to major developers and owners (Trump has 25 structures in the US, Canada, India, Panama, South Korea, Philippines, and Turkey). Elevation images of the buildings show the prominence of Trump’s brand in cities around the world. By comparing other major global brands to the controversial name of Donald Trump, the project reveals the political and economic forces driving the construction of the built environment, and their effects on skylines.</p>

<p>Since the election of Trump, his brand and corporate holdings have spurred controversy both in the United States and around the world. In the Philippines, where relations are currently strained due to Rodrigo Duerte’s unjustified killings associated with a perceived “drug war”, Trump Tower Manila recently finished construction. In Istanbul, President Erdogan has called for Donald Trump’s name to be removed from his development after the announcement of the “Muslim ban”. In Sunny Isles Beach, Florida, there are 66 units owned by individuals with Russian passports representing over $100M in assets. Additional controversies have swirled around the incomplete Trump Tower in Azerbaijan and the three planned towers in Rio which have now come to a halt in the pre-construction phase after the election results. </p>
