        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p class="bioText">Our project compares two graphical interpretations of the 2008 recession produced by the New York Times. Both show how the recession impacted industry and trade, but using different methodologies. At their core, the first and most obvious differentiating factor is the use of two vs. three dimensional displays. As we delve in further, the differences go beyond just an extra dimension on the displays, to the data which was chosen and the structure of the storytelling through different lenses. While the two dimensional representation breaks down impacts and recovery into specific categories (services, media, insurance, housing, etc.) with an American centric focus, the three dimensional representation takes a macro approach by summarizing economic impacts with one statistic, Federal government’s interest rates. The method of storytelling, one told by a macro comparison of international governments and the other a micro breakdown of American industries, create different narratives surrounding the same event. Neither method is inherently better or worse. However, in the case of these two particular visualizations, we will ultimately come to a conclusion as to which approach, 2D and granular or 3D and macroscopic, is more effective at conveying the story behind the data.

            <h3>How the Recession Reshaped the Economy, in 255 Charts</h3>
            <p class="bioText"><br>
             The narrative told by the 255 charts can be summarized as a divided America. When viewing all of the charts, either together or separated, it becomes apparent that almost all sectors of employment and industry took a hit during 2008 and subsequently many have recovered. The visualization tells a story of different sectors in America which have declined and continue to do so in contrast to ones which are thriving. Business, health care, clean energy, and professional services are on the rise while manufacturing, construction, and coal production have been in a continual downwards spiral since 2008. The divide is not necessarily new information, but the visualization shows the extremes and adds quantitative information to the discussion. It tells a story which continues to be at the center of American politics, employment sector division and the deindustrialization of the United States.

            <h3>A 3-D View of a Chart That Predicts The Economic Future</h3>
            <p class="bioText"><br>
              This three dimensional graph illustrates how much it will cost the government to borrow money and therefore suggests it can predict of the country's economic future. The flow of the narrative is nice in that the graph changes position to highlight certain areas. It walks the reader through the argument in pieces. This is essential otherwise key ares of the graph would not be understood by an uninitiated reader. The 3D graph moves between section, elevation and axon views to increase or decrease the amount of graphic data for the reader to consume. However, the text uses some technical language from the financial industry that is not too hard to understand but carries a different meaning depending on the experience of the person reading it. There is a level of examination one must do between the text and the graphic to understand the points being made. Lastly, its not immediately evident how the graph is a prediction of the future economy, or at least its not its not clearly evident by the graphic representation alone.

              Line graphs and area charts are used in this project to display the data. All of the data used for the visualizations was obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS) Current Employment Statistics program. The BLS is a government agency which does a sampling of employment around the United States and publishes this report on a monthly basis. At the top of the page, line charts are utilized with wages on the x-axis and number of jobs on the y-axis. As each line graph moves from left to right it indicates an increase in average salary and as the slope goes upward or downward it shows an increase or decrease in employment.  Additionally, a color scale is used to indicate the rate of recovery. The darker the shades of green and red, the more extreme recovery or decline associated with the industry. As a user scrolls down the page, the sectors become separated and specific industries highlighted from within the amalgamation of the 255 lines. Initially, they are separated into anecdotes of employment sectors with titles such as “A Long Housing Bust” and “Black Gold Rush” to emphasize strengths and weaknesses pre and post-recession.  At the bottom of the page, each specification within different industries is given a color coded employment area graph. In the separation of job sectors, the user can see a more granular display of exactly which jobs have flourished or diminished. All of the information is displayed on one page and as the user scrolls down it becomes more separated and distinct as compared to an overview of employment in the United States which is provided at the top.

              The 3D visualization uses a combination of line graphs and heat map to display data representing the interest rate for government borrowing money across multiple long- and short-term time periods. Data regarding the United States economy was taken from the US Treasury Department, while German data is from Deutsche Bundesbank, the central bank of Germany, and Japanese data from Thomson Reuters. Line graphs for interest rates ranging from 1-month to 30-year periods are connected to create the three-dimensional surface, with the height, representing the percent yield per year, translated into a color gradient from blue to white to red (below zero). The x-, y- and z-axes are labeled, respectively, according to time, length of borrowing period, and percent yield (per year). Viewed from above, the colored surface looks like a heat map, while a side view reveals a single black line graph (the 10-year yield) with the blue surface gradient giving context. While the US data remains above the 0% yield plane, German and Japanese rates turn the surface red as they dip into the negative yield range. Flipping between US, German and Japanese yield charts, one can compare the relative stability or volatility of key markets across three continents. The 3D visualization is interactive, allowing viewers to pan and orbit around to observe the surface from any angle, though zooming does not appear to be possible since the mouse wheel only scrolls up and down.

              Some of the elements described above facilitate the legibility of the graph. The use of red and green help distinguish between those industries with job recovery from those with job decline. Within each line graph, a red bar marks the start and end of the recession, which helps to interpret how each industry was performing before and after the recession. Additionally, within each line graph, when cursing over the graph, both the number of jobs and average salary appear. The average salary for each month is given, but only there for reference as the individual graphs do not plot the increase/decrease in salaries. This addition somewhat clouded the legibility of the graph; it is not relevant for visualization within each individual graph. It is only relevant in the collection of line graphs, where line graphs are distributed by their pre-recession salaries.  The collection of graphs places these industries on a wage scale, which helps compare how low and high paying industries changed over time. However, this aspect of the graph could be easier to read; the graphs could have also mapped the change in salary, which is not the same as the change in number of jobs.

              The interactive feature of this 3D graph allows readers to move around at their disposal and therefore gives close-up detail of certain areas of the graph, facilitating the legibility of the graph, but the additional third dimension somewhat adds complexity for the reader to precisely grasp the numerical value of the graph. To help present the data, different shades of blue represent the relative level of interest rate in the history, similar to the style of heat map. The darker the shades of blue, the higher the level of interest rate. So the near white color since 2008 clearly shows record low interest rate level and reflects the continuing hangover from the recession. Moreover, the grid helps the reader catch the absolute position or value on x-, y-, and z-axes for certain points on the 3D surface. However, the characteristics of three dimension makes readers hard to accurately investigate the quantitative relationships. For example, it is much harder to identify the exact numerical changes across years for the 3-month to 20-year Treasury, because they appear in the middle position in one axis.

              What is easiest to interpret from the collection of charts is the effect of the recession of on job growth per industry. However, it is not easy to interpret how wages were affected. The use of color only reflects the increase or decrease in jobs, while the chart reader must look into each line individually to see how salaries were affected. Industry performance and economic resilience ought not to be measured solely by the number of jobs, but also the salaries of those same jobs. The effect of the recession on wage salaries is not represented graphically, and is thus difficult to interpret. The graph, for example, illustrates that most lower-wage jobs have increased in number of jobs, but now how those salaries have changed. While the effect on salaries is hard to read, related industries and the recession’s effect is easier to interpret. The selected anecdotes of related industries helps to paint a more informative picture of the effect of the recession on such industries. This is further elaborated in the collection of industries by type following the aggregation of 255 charts; however, this approach, which eliminates the use of the line graphs on a wage scale, removes the ability to compare visually in the way that the highlighted anecdotes allows.

              We can clearly see from this 3D graph the general trend of long term and short term interest rates during the history of American economy. Particularly, as the emphasis of this visualization project, the severe drop during the Great Recession and rather flat and almost zero short term interest rate after the crisis are easy to grasp from the graph. While the Yield Curve is a technical concept in Economics, the project provides in brief text the basic explanation and describes its implication on showing what the economy will be like in the future, so the graph forecasts the trend of American economy from the perspective of the price of money. Although it is hard to get the exact numbers and quantitative changes from the 3D graph due to the reduction of legibility with the additional dimension, we can still get a general idea through the major trend and relative level from the graph. The short term interest rates maintain a close to zero level for almost six years since 2008, and the long term rates are also lower than the history record, all showing a lingering consequence of the financial crisis and a negative outlook for future economic growth.

            Both of the data visualizations produced by the New York Times are superb examples of how visual and narrative design can illuminate trends and facilitate understanding of complex economic systems. While each project has its own merits and shortcomings, our decision as to which approach was most successful came down to visual legibility and granularity. In the end, it was clear that 255 2D charts were more effective than a few 3D charts in conveying data at multiple scales, from the industry-wide aggregate to the job-specific details. The 3D visualization is particularly weak when it comes to revealing interesting yet minute details (with the exception of a small spike in short-term interest rates in 2008 when Congress threatened to default, which can only be seen when zoomed in). By combining many 2D line charts into one 3D surface, the viewer loses the ability to read precise values, especially toward the middle range. The aggregation of many 2D charts, on the other hand, allows general trends to be observed without obscuring the data contained in any one graph. It also allows various charts to move smoothly between foreground and background, highlighting interesting relationships and embedded narratives without sacrificing context.

            It could be argued that both visualizations are three-dimensional, although not necessarily in their spatial representation. The 255 charts are organized along two axes, wages and number of jobs, but there is an additional temporal element embedded in each line graph, showing the change in number of jobs in each industry across the same time period. These graphs could have easily been displayed in a 3D format similar to the Yield Curve project, but the alternative would risk obfuscating the details contained in each. The pop-up window which appears when hovering over a graph, displaying precise wages and number of jobs at any given time, may have added a potentially confusing extra layer to the display, but it is also a useful window into the actual data. Such a feature would have been especially useful in the 3D chart, as ultimately the project's downfall is its inability to convey the granularity of the data clearly and accurately.
