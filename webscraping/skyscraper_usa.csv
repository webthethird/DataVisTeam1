- Part of the massive Peachtree Center Development, the Westin Peachtree Plaza was the tallest hotel in the world when completed. It was the tallest skyscraper in Atlanta from time of completion until 1987, when it was surpassed by One Atlantic Center. Even though it has been overshadowed by taller and newer buildings, it is still known as Atlanta's ""signature"" tower, and has been featured on various postcards, television programs, and movies, which has made it instantly recognizable to the general public.



- The hotel features 80,000 square feet of meeting space on floors 6 through 14 (note that the floor labels begin with the first underground parking level), and 1,068 guest rooms on floors 15 through 70. Floors 71 through 73 contain a revolving restaurant, observation deck, and lounge called the Sundial Bar & View, which is accessed through two external glass elevators. Other points of interest include an indoor pool with a retractable glass dome and a massive four level underground parking deck with space for 1,000 automobiles. The hotel recently underwent a 40 million dollar renovation, remodeling every square inch of the hotel and adding ammenities such as high speed internet access and computerized HVAC controls in the guest rooms.



- The front entrance at Peachtree Street is 7.01 meters (23 feet) higher than the back entrance.

• At the time of it's planning the building would have been the tallest residential building in the city with highest swimming pool in Texas. It has been on hold however for sometime due to the tech bust and further worries after 9/11. 



• First planned in 2000 to be a 320 foot, 28-story condo tower with 129 units, the project has been revived under new owners and will be larger than originally proposed with up to 35 floors and 320 units with both condos and apartments as well as retail. Residences would have the same ammenities and services as the adjacent Four Seasons Hotel.



• At 35 floors the project would need a zoning change to be approved for the increased height. The site is currently approved for 318 feet and 29 floors. The new plans also call for the tower to run parallel to Cesar Chavez Street rather than San Jacinto Boulevard as originally planned.

The tower was unoccupied and inaccessible for 14 years before Marriott converted it into an 80 room hotel.

Replaced Boston's original Custom House, which was completed in 1847. The famous clock in the upper tower is 22 feet wide. Tallest building in Boston for 49 years; surpassed in 1964 by the Prudential Tower.

The second floor of the lobby features a rotating selection of exhibits from the Peabody Essex Museum.

The 26th floor of the hotel features an indoor/outdoor observation deck that provides guests a 360-degree view of the city and surrounding areas.

• Originally the Willis Tower was going to be two twin towers occupying the site at half the height of the current tower.



• When completed as the Sears Tower in 1973 it surpassed One World Trade Center in New York City, completed earlier that year as the World’s Tallest Building. It stayed the WTB from 1973 to 1996, where the Petronas Towers in Malaysia surpassed it, although this was only possible because of the spires atop the buildings, counting by roof height the Willis Tower remained the tallest until 2003 when Taipei 101 in Taiwan was completed, 19 feet taller than the Willis Tower’s roof.



• The building's structure is a ""bundled tube"" system of nine squares with sides of 75 feet (for an overall width of 225 x 225 btw. exterior column lines and 229' at outside faces).  Height to width ratio is 6.45:1.  The tower was completed for $160 Million and used 76,000 tons of steel, 72,000 cubic yards of concrete, 17,500 tons of mechanical equipment.  At peak construction, over 2,400 workers were on site representing 60 different subcontractors.  There are 76 single-deck elevators in addition to 14 double-deck elevators, bringing the total to 104 cabs.  Other impressive quantities include 25,000 miles of plumbing and 2,000 miles of electrical wire.	



• The building has been climbed up twice, by Dan Goodwin in 1981 and by Alain Robert in 1999.



• Sears is no longer headquartered in this building, having sold the building and moved out to Hoffman Estates, Illinois in 1992.



• The ""Skydeck Pavilion"" entrance on Wacker Drive was added in 1985, the large antennas in 1982, and the 4 HDTV antennas in 1999 (or thereabouts).  Extra height was added to the western antenna on 5th June 2000.



• The Willis Tower has become one of America’s most iconic skyscrapers, appearing in several movies, books, and television shows since its completion in 1973.



• The building was officially renamed the Willis Tower on July 16, 2009, after a London-based holdings firm retained the naming rights along with leasing space on multiple floors within the building.

- This project was intended to be developed as several smaller buildings having different functions but within the same parcel.  The project developer wanted a 50 storey office tower (1 million sq.ft.) along with a 70 storey residential complex (also 1 million sq.ft.) and 800,00 sq.ft. of combined commercial space and parking.  The plan put forth by the S.O.M. Architect-Engineer team of Bruce Graham & Fazlur Khan called for stacking all of this components into a single 100 storey tower of comparable square footage.  The structural system (a braced tube) was made possible by new and emerging computer analysis techniques.  The tapered shape allows for smaller residential plates over office plates over commercial plates and opens up a wider environment at the plaza.



- The observation deck is unusual in that part of it has a screen window instead of the standard plate glass.  



- Building topped-out 6 May 1968.



- The base of the building has dimensions of 80.77 by 50.29 meters (north-south by east-west).  The building narrows towards the top at 32 by 19.8 meters.



- Member of ""World Federation of Great Towers"".



- In 1969, it was the 2nd tallest building in the world.

• Construction officially began with drilling of first caisson on March 17, 2005.



• Building was completed in 2009 to become the second tallest building in the city and the country, surpassed only by the 442m (1,451ft) Willis Tower. However, it will be surpassed by One World Trade Center in 2013, currently under construction in New York.



• The buildings is the tallest building in the world with an all-concrete structure at the time.



• Design of glassy Setbacks at 3 levels matching its surroundings the heights of the Wrigley building's main block, the Twin Towers of marina city, and the IBM building. An asymmetric shape gives the building a different appearance from each angle because of its triangle site.



• Highest residential units on the 89th floor breaking the 37-year world record held by the John Hancock Center.



• The silvery color of the stainless steel facade forms a transition between the brilliant white terra cotta of the east Wrigley Building and the west black 330 North Wabash.



• A projecting stainless steel latticework on the facade gives the building surface an impression of depth, reinforced by the metalwork's glass facade reflection.



• The building was originally planned with a large office section on the lower floors, but sales of the residential portion performed so well that the office floors were dropped from the plan. The floorplan tapers gradually in four steps at heights of 65, 121, 201 and 338 meters.



• The spire will rise from a glassy cylinder, surrounded at its base by a futuristic screen wall covering the mechanical elements.



• Residential floors on the mid-levels above the trump international hotel will be convertible for hotel usage at the discretion of the unit owners.



• When this project was originally announced, it was proclaimed as a future world's tallest building. After the terrorist acts of september 11, 2001 the plans were scaled down a few hundred feet.



• An abandoned freight tunnel, roughly 40 to 45 feet under the surface, runs partway below the site formerly occupied by the low-rise headquarters of the chicago sun-times, one of the city's two major newspapers.

The original marble cladding of Aon Centre bowed under the temperature swings experienced in the Chicago climate. The cladding was 32mm (1.25"") thick Itallian Carrera Marble (similar to what Michaelangelo used), but 20 years after original construction it had severly deteriorated.  The marble was replaced with 51mm (2"") thick Mt. Airy Granite at a cost of $80M between 1990 and 1992 (43,000 individual 1.27m x 1.14m [50"" x 45""] panels).

• Building was hit by a tornado, 28th March 2000.



• The blownout window panels were covered over, as a temporary measure, with sheets of plywood.  This method was deemed to be a fire hazard and the plywood was eventually replaced with steel sheet metal.



• The cost to demolish the building was considered to be too prohibative because of the use of asbestos in the original construction.  Likewise, rehabiliation would be expensive for the same reason.  So, the building sat vacant for a number of years and was referred to as the ""Block 82 Tower"" in reference to it's city parcel designation.



• In the fall of 2003, plans to rehabilitate the Tower were underway and included a new energy efficient green-tinted glass facade, a new ground level podium structure offering better pedestrian access and luxurious residential condominiums and apartments.



• The structure, which was Fort Worth's first downtown skyscraper when it was completed in 1974, will gain 2 new occupiable floors (which were previously used for mechanical space) and have a new two-floor penthouse above that (36+2=38 total).  The ground level will be redeveloped into commercial space.  The project is expected to cost $65 Million including $16 in city and county grants.



• The building should be ready for occupants by January 2005 according to Emporis.

Built by the Chamber of Commerce to replace the county owned Record Building, the Chamber Building was the top office building in Greenville, with rents between $35.00 to $45.00 a month.  The skyscraper opened November 2, 1925. 



The building featured two fast Otis elevators, a wash basin, an outlet for an electric fan and telephone service in each office.



To make the slender building as light and as strong as possible, it was built with solid steel columns and a brick veneer over hollow tiles for the walls.



A copper box holding copies of the daily newspapers for January 12, 1925, a roster of Chamber members, current photographs of Greenville (including, an airplane view), and coins, were sealed and placed in the cornerstone, which was inscribed ""A Gate of Friendliness on the Pathway of Commerce.""



The building was restored by Southerland Construction in 2001.

• The 30-foot tall statue at the top is named ""Victory.""



• The Soldiers and Sailors Monument stands in the very middle of Monument 342-foot diameter Circle, a prominent meeting point in downtown Indianapolis.



• Its estensive renovation by Schmidt Associates and Geupel DeMars was completed in 1989, only recognized in 1990 with the Monumental Award, representing the most significant visual and physical enhancement in Marion County.

 

• There is the Colonel Eli Lilly Civil War Museum located in the monument's lower level.



• Constructed of gray oolitic limestone, the monument commemorates Indiana war dead from 1776-1865.



• The site was once home to the Governor's Mansion, but no Governor ever resided in the house. The empty structure was razed in 1857.



• Its Limestone Sculptures at base are the work of Austrian Sculptor Rudolf Schwarz and the Bronze Astragal, work of Nicolaus Geiger of Berlin.



• The monument was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.



• An indoor observation deck at the 244.5-foot level can be reached by a single elevator or stairway.

Caesers Palace Resort & Casino History



1966 - 1970's

• Caesers Palace opened in 1966 with the 16 Story Roman Tower. In 1967 Evel Knievel attempted his famous jump over the Caesers Palace fountains and failed. The 14 Story Centurion Tower was added in 1970, an addition was made to the Roman Tower in 1974. 



1979 - 1980's

• In 1979 the 22 story Fantasy Tower (now Fourm Tower) was constructed. In 1980, at the base of the then Fantasy Tower, the domed Omnimax Theater (later renamed Circus Maximus) was added in 1980. In 1989, Evel Knievel's son, Robbie Knievel attempted and succeeded jumping the Caesars Palace fountains.



1992 - 2000's

• The Caesars Palace Fourm Shops Shopping Mall was completed in 1992, which would expand many times later. In 1997 the 29 Story Palace Tower was completed, along with more shops, convention space, and pools. In 2000, to match the Palace Tower's romanesque design, all three towers where remodeled, along with the demolition of the Omnimax Theatre. 



2001 - Future

The Long Beach World Trade Center was originally conceived as a massive complex of five towers, one reaching 650 feet. Unfortunately, only phase one's 30 storey tower and Hilton hotel were completed. 



The current owners of the WTC property plan to build a second office tower and two 20+ storey residential structures.

Located on a beachfront bluff at 800 East Ocean Boulevard in Long Beach, California, groundbreaking for the Villa Riviera building began in December of 1927 with opening day planned for December 1928.  



The project was conceived and developed by Lionel V. Mayell, successful developer of other classic Long Beach high rises such as the Cooper Arms and the Artaban.  Mayell’s concept utilized local architect Richard D. King’s design of a 20 floor Gothic revival high-rise that won 1st place in an international contest.  



At the time of completion, the Villa was only 3 feet shorter than the tallest building in southern California - Los Angeles City Hall at 464 feet.  



As with most of Mayell’s many projects both here and on the east coast, “The Villa” was originally conceived and operated as luxury “stock co-operative” (or “own-your-own”) residential apartments, not as a hotel or rental units as is widely believed. It wasn’t until after the Stock Market crash and infamous Long Beach earthquake that the Mortgage Guarantee Company was forced to foreclose on Mayell’s cooperative in 1933.  



This began a period of hotel operation for the Villa, which went through a succession of owners for the next 22 years.



The building astonishingly survived the devastating 1933 Long Beach Earthquake with mostly superficial cosmetic damage, due in no small part to Richard King’s extensive studies of the effects of earthquakes in Japan just prior to designing the Villa.  



Shortly after foreclosure, Mortgage Guarantee installed a neon Art Deco “Apartment-Hotel” sign over the entrance in 1934 and continued to run the building until 1937, when Joseph M. Schenck of Twentieth Century-Fox bought it for his ex wife/silent film star Norma Talmadge.  



As the “Villa Riviera Company” they had aspirations of huge additions and remodeling, but fortunately they defaulted on their loan and Mortgage Guarantee leased the building to Consolidated Hotels for its operations beginning in 1940.  After that lease expired, the building was auctioned off to the Burger Hotel Company in 1943, and was again sold to hotelier George Allen in 1946.  



During this time, the Villa was commonly referred to as the “Home of Admirals” as many officers in the U.S. Navy occupied it. To this day, a brass US Geological Survey (USGS) plaque is still embedded on the balcony of the Villa's tower demonstrating its historical importance to ocean going-vessels along the coast.  



It was also during this time that many significant “improvements” and modifications were done or attempted by Allen, including the circle driveway, a 2nd neon sign on the tower, nightclub in the garage, fountain on the front lawn, and further lobby remodeling.  In 1954 Allen sold the hotel to the Morris Hotel Chain of Beverly Hills, who also operated other hotels such as the Hotel Clark in Los Angeles and the Hotel San Diego.  



The hotel operation would last only 1 more year and in 1955 the building was again sold-off to what was called the Villa Holding Company.  



This company reverted many of the past hotel modifications so the building could again become residential, and the units were sold off as individual “own-your-own” apartments.  



During the 1970s the building was threatened with condemnation due to strict enforcement of new fire codes, but the struggling association managed to raise enough money to enclose the spectacular open staircases and install fire rated doors and sprinklers throughout.  



In 1979 the Villa was designated a historical landmark by Long Beach Cultural Heritage, but by the late 1980s the Villa was ironically imperiled (along with countless other Long Beach structures) by the demands of new earthquake codes.  



Once again the homeowner’s association met this new challenge by installing the required retrofits.  In 1991 the association was converted to condominium titles, and the Villa finally earned its rightful place on the prestigious National Register of Historic Places in 1996.    



As always, the Villa continues to thrive as downtown’s pre-eminent landmark, and is the subject of many writings, art projects, movie locations, photos, special events, and promotional literature and public murals.

Once the tallest building in LA, the Rosslyn boasted in it's large rooftop sign as being the ""Fireproof Million Dollar Hotel.""



It's best years are behind it now, seeing some minor glory in 1987 as the rooftop site of U2's music video for ""Where the Streets Have no Name.""



Today the Rosslyn is a flop house, with rooms going for $8 a night. The seedy side of downtown Los Angeles lives here now (2003).

• Current Tallest building in Tennessee.  

• Local inhabitants called it sweetly ""Batman Building"" for its sleek profile with twin spires similar to the superhero's pointed ears.  

• The communications dish atop the main part of the building is covered by the tri-star design, representing the ""Volunteer"" symbol of the Tennessee state flag.  

• It's very similar a building in Melbourne Australia, the Melbourne Central Office Tower.

Architect: Leonard Spangenberg, Jr. & Associates



• The tower was originally designed primarily as an office tower, but had room for residential areas on the top floor.  The top floors were never used as residential space, though.



• Construction of this tower started in 1964, but was halted in October of 1966, when the property was bought out.  It resumed construction in 1968, and was completed the following year.



• The building was officially shuttered in 2002, as it had been poorly maintained, and was filled with asbestos and toxic mold.



• This building is planned for restoration, complete with a new facade.  It will be converted from office space to luxury condominium units.

Facts & :



• Part of the New World Trade Center, which is expected to be completed in 2012 - 2013. Link to Project Diagram:

http://skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?buildingID=7788,7801,7802,7803,7804,7422&orderby=buildingIDorder



• The building will be the tallest in New York City and the country upon completion, and one of the tallest in world. 



• The building has been renamed by the Port Authority (owner) in spring 2009 from Freedom Tower to One World Trade Center. 



• This is the buildings second official design. The first, designed by David Childs in collaboration with Daniel Libeskind, was disregarded due to concerns raised by the New York Police department that the building would be vulnerable to a car bomb blast. The second design was planed by David Childs of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM) and was made public in 2006, shortly before construction started.



• The roof height is the same as original One World Trade Center. The building is topped out by a 124-meter (408-foot) spire. So the tower rises 1,776 feet (541-meter) which marks the year of the American declaration of Indepedence. The spire's tip is considered to architectural top of the building (simiular to other new skyscrapers) because it was designed for this highrise as such and not only as an antenna.



• The building now officialy 105 Floors tall, instead of 82. The base will occupy floors 1 - 19, Floors 20 - 63 will be offices, floor 64 will be a skylobby, floors 65 - 88 will also be offices. Floors 89 - 99 will be Mechanical floors, floors 100 - 102 will be used for Observation and other public uses. Floors 103 - 105 will then be more Mechanical Floors. 



• The new design attempts to address the NYPD's concerns with its 186.5-foot-high reinforced concrete blast resistant base, which will contain the Freedom Tower's 80-foot tall lobby and three of its mechanical floors. 



• The base of the tower, which was originally to be clad in polished steel and titanium like 7 WTC, will now be covered in vertical bands of glass prisms. The base will have no windows except for several tall narrow ones which will be placed a minimum of 25 feet above the ground.



• The cornerstone of One WTC was laid in July 2004, before the redesign was deemed necessary. The stone was then removed in mid 2006 as foundation work for the tower began. Foundation work is fully completed in 2009 and the towers steel begun to rise towards the sky. Expected topping out is in 2012 and completion is planned in 2013 with a total cost of more than 3 billion US-$.

 

• After lengthy and combative negotiations that resulted in a reconfigured lease agreement between the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (the owner of the World Trade Center) and Larry Silverstein (the leaseholder of the complex), construction of the Freedom Tower began on April 27, 2006. Not long after the start of construction, a new battle with the insurers of the World Trade Center resulted from the reconfiguration of the lease. The court battle now threatens to delay or end construction.

• The Empire State Building is one of the most famous skyscrapers in the world, built in just 18 months during the Great Depression, it was the world's tallest building in 1931–1972 (also world's tallest structure till 1954 and free-standing one till 1967).



• It's original cost, including the price of land, was $40,948,000, a very low figure for a building of this size even at that time. The building itself cost only $24,718,000.



• The Empire State Building was built on the former site of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.



• The shape of the Empire State Building was inspired by its developer, John Jakob Raskob, who is said to have pulled a pencil from his drawer, held it up to his architect (William Lamb), and asked ""Bill, how tall can you make it so that it won't fall down?"" 



• The observation tower at the top of the Empire State Building was originally intended to be a dock for mooring airships. However, after several futile attempts at mooring a zeppelin in the strong winds present at 1250 feet, the idea was scrapped.



• On a Saturday, July 1945, a B-25 bomber crashed into Empire State Building's 79th floor, which housed the Catholic War Relief Services. Only 14 people died and the Empire State Building reopened 2 days later.



• The top of the Empire State Building is lit up at night in different colors to celebrate various holidays. For a long time after Sept. 11, 2001, it was continuously lit red, white, and blue.



• The height of the antenna has been decreased from 448.7 meters (1472 feet) to 443.2 meters (1454 feet).



• After 09.11.2001, it regained its title as the tallest building in NYC, lost from the destruction of WTC twin towers. ESB was surpassed by One World Trade Center in 2013.



• The 86th floor observatory is visited by 3.5 milllion people every year. 



• Member of ""World Federation of Great Towers"".

Facts & : 



• Cost: US$195 million (USD).



• Counting spires and antennas the Citigroup Center is the 6th tallest building in New York City and 5th tallest in Midtown. Not counting spires and antennas the Citigroup Center is the 4th tallest in the city and 3rd tallest in Midtown. The inclinated part was originally intended to hold solar power conversion panels.

 

• Being one of the first buildings in NYC to break out of the International 'box' style, the structure is supported by four exterior megacolumns at the center of each side and an octagonal core. This arrangement permited the developers to construct a large tower overtop of St. Peter's Lutheran Church where columns would otherwise reside. Additional air-rights were purchased from the church and allowed the tower to become one of the tallest in the city. The four corners are cantilevered 72' beyond the edge of the columns which rise 114' above the plaza to the first office floor.



• This column arrangement is not without its problems though and the behaviour of the lateral load resisting system was unwittingly changed as a result of the contrator's suggestion to substitute bolted for welded connections.



• It was only after completion of the tower that the original designer suspected a potential danger in the bolted connection and convinced the owners to undertake strengthening the joints. The tower's bolted joints were too weak to withstand 70mph wind. During the summer of 1978, work crews welded plate reinforcing to key diagonals to make the structure safe. Six weeks into the repair Hurricane Ella heading right for New York City and the tower was only half done with the repairs. The City was just hours away from disaster but luckily Hurricane Ella turned eastward away from the city giving the constructon workers enough time to fix the tower. Even though nothing happened the crisis was kept hidden from the public for almost 20 years.



• The 160' (48.8m) ""crown"" above the 59th floor was originally intended to provide high-rent condominium units but zoning bylaws prevented this development. The designers also contemplated using the sloped surface as a solar energy collector, but this proved unfeasible and the southerly orientation remained as part of the final design.  The crown also houses one of the first Tuned Mass Dampers used in a tall building design (see also John Hancock Tower in Boston). The TMD comprises a solid 400-ton block of concrete resting on oil-film bearings and electronically controlled actuators over 800'(240m) above the ground for building stability. 



• The Double-decker elevator cars reduce the area devoted to the vertical circulation core, leaving more space available for offices first also thought to have residents, but abandonned due to zone laws.



• The architects were recognized with an Honor Award from the American Institute of Architects in 1979 because the condition first skyscraper in the U.S. to be built with a tuned mass damper ontop narrow base above the old church.



• Renovations are undertaken in 2004 at roof and 1997 in lobby.

• The louvers in the dome lent themselves to whistling in high winds and in 1991 every other louver was removed to help silence this effect. Although the whistling has ceased, the building still displays large lateral movements (owing to it's slender N-S dimension) in high winds. These movements are enough to cause water to slosh around in a glass.

Part of a dense cluster of very tall residential skyscrapers including the face-to-face Metropolitan Tower and Carnegie Hall Tower and the Cityspire overlooking the two towers.



The Carnegie Hall Tower is on the same block as the Metropolitan Tower, so the tower completely blocks views to the south. Luckily both towers have their Elevator Shafts facing each other.



The building is physically sandwiched between the landmark seven storey Carnegie Music Hall and the famous five storey Russian Tea Room on West 57th Street.  The exterior patterns and colors incorporated into masonry and reinforced concrete are derived from its namesake building.  However, the most notable feature of this tower is the use of closely spaced steel sections on three faces of the roof to create a modern cornice.



This remarkable skyscraper measures only 50 feet (15.2m) on it's front face and up to 75 feet (22.9m) including the protruding face.  The structural system of closely spaced reinforced concrete columns created a more efficient highrise than a steel frame.  This is perhaps an ironic turn of events given that the Carnegie fortune was derived from the steel industry.  Although the original analysis of this stiff vertical tube did not require motion control, space was reserved in the rooftop for a mechanical damper should it ever be needed.

The Equitable Building covers an entire city block; at the time of its completion in 1915, it was the largest office building in the world. Of course, massive buildings cast massive shadows and the Equitable Building's shadow was just that: huge. It was so large, in fact, that it sparked widespread public outrage. So great was the outcry that New York adapted zoning codes that required buildings to be set back at various heights, and limited unrestricted height to a quarter of the lot. These zoning rules, and the setbacks they require, came to define the look of New York's highrises for years to come.

Facts  

- Shortly after the Prudential Company's new building was completed in 1942, it was taken over by the federal government for use by the Office of Dependency Benefits (ODB), which was moved to Newark from Washington. The ODB was responsible for payments to military dependents and their families. Work went on round the clock at 213 Washington Street until it was returned to Prudential in 1946.

1988 Reclad and Expansion Cost: $100 million



Built in 1959, the 10-storey Sun Bank Building was reclad and expanded with a west tower in 1988 to serve as the bank's Florida headquarters. The two towers share the same lobby and are connected by an 8-storey atrium that serves as a secondary entrance. The main entrance to both towers is located in the 1959 wing.



The consulates of Argentina and Great Britain are located in the SunTrust Center, along with the trade offices of Qingdao, China.

• It replaces the Sheraton Penn Center Hotel formerly stood on this site empty for years. This is today the tallest building in Philadelphia, surpassing One Liberty Place as well as Cleveland's Key Tower.



• This project has changed somewhat since it was first proposed in 2001. Initially, it was a 50 storey 223m tower and later incorporated a second smaller office building (Two Pennsylvania Plaza) within the same property. A previously Original design changed from a golden Kasota stone as an homage to the Philadelphia Museum of Art to this glassy tower.



• A later concept, unveiled in early 2004, called for the tower to rise to 293m at the peak of it pyramidal cap and reign as the city's new tallest.   Speculation surrounding the project suggested that it could be made real through a large lease deal and Keystone Opportunity Zone (KOZ) tax incentives.



• The newest design, released in January 2005, eliminates the pyramidal cap and raises the height to over 297m (975 feet). Construction started in mid-january 2005 and was ready for occupancy starting in 2007. The design calls for a reinforced concrete (vertical) frame and steel floors.  Floor heights vary from 4.6m (15') on the lower floors to 5.2m( 17') in the upper reaches.

• The most distinctive features of this building are the tapering edges of the four projected faces and the grill-like pyramid crown.  The tower's floor-plates are thus series of diminishing cruciform shapes within a 154' square plan.  To accomplish this feature structurally, 12 special taper columns are incorporated into the remaining perimeter columns.



• The podium structure is designed to integrate pedestrian function and mimics both the color and style of the local surroundings.  The tower then uses strong vertical lines, reflective glass, overhanging capitols and a pyramidal crown to compliment the nearby 491' City Hall.  This building is also one of firsts:  it was one of the first to break the unwritten 491' height limit and it was Philadelphia's first composite (Structural Steel & Concrete) highrise.

• The triangular building's most striking feature is its massive exterior steel columns used showcase a new product (at the time) called Cor-ten steel. 



• Known as the U.S. Steel Building from 1970 to 1988, when it was renamed the USX Tower. In 2002 the building's name was changed back to the U.S. Steel Tower.



• The building was the first in history to use liquid-fireproofed columns. 



• Rockwell International Corporation was headquartered in this building from 1970 to the mid-1980's, in that time a large model of the Rockwell NASA Space Shuttle stood in the lobby.



• In 2008, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center moved into the top five floors and purchased three 20 foot tall signs reading ""UPMC"" on the top three sides of the building. 



• When it was completed, the U.S. Steel Tower was the tallest building between Chicago and New York City and the tallest in the state of Pennsylvania. It lost that title to One Liberty Place in Philadelphia in 1987. The building still remains as the tallest in Pittsburgh.

The current design was selected from a competition comprising two other entries, one by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP, the other by the Richard Rogers Partnership, and could become the tallest building on the West Coast of the United States.



A taller, earlier design for the tower was 366 m / 1200 with 80 storys.



The Transbay Terminal Tower will be part of the Transbay Terminal redevelopment district that will include parks, redesigned streets, and high and lowrise condo and office towers.

The ""wings"" projecting from the sides of the building contain elevator shafts and stairwells, the wings start at the 29th floor.



The Transamerica Pyramid has 3,678 windows and 16,000 cubic yards of concrete. It takes one month to wash all 3,678 windows.



Transamerica Corp. wanted to build the Transamerica Pyramid 1,150 feet high, but the city planning commission would not approve because it would block views of the San Francisco bay from Nob Hill.



The tower opened in the summer of 1972.  It was the world's seventh tallest building when built.



Exavation started on the Transamerica Pyramid in December 1969, the first steel beam was placed in November 1970.



Even though the Transamerica Pyramid isnt the headquarters for Transamerica, the companies logo is the tower.

Built as a ferry terminal back when no bridges spanned the Bay, the Ferry Building found itself in search of a function after the Bay Bridge opened in 1936.  This led to the subdivision of the interior into office and retail space in the 1950s.  



Demolition of the Embarcadero Freeway in 1991 led to renewed interest in the building.  Renovation began in 1998 and lasted for four years, and the building now hosts retail and offices within a restored main hall.  Farmers Markets are held in and around the building four days a week, see website for details.  



The ferry docks themselves are located behind and to the side of the building.

• Tallest building in Seattle. While it was originally marketed as being the tallest building west of the Mississippi, it still holds the title for most floors in the United States outside New York City and Chicago.  While both the J.P. Morgan Chase Building in Houston and Library Tower in L.A. are taller, neither has more floors with 75 and 73 respectively.



• The building was originally supposed to be 1,005 feet, however the FAA required a reduction in height for the project given it's proximity to the Seattle Tacoma International Airport, thus taking away Seattle's chance for a 1000 footer. The developer (Martin Selig) wanted to retain the same amount of leasing space in the tower, so instead of simply reducing the total number of floors, 6 inches was removed from each of the 72 office floors.  The tower rises from a deep 120' excavation using conventional steel framing and three composite steel-concrete super-columns positioned on the center of each of the three faces.  Each super-column was made from some of the first commercially available High Strength Concrete (fc' up to 9600 psi) and measures 8' x 12' at the base (tapering to 3' x 3' at the top) while resting on 48' square footings 14' thick.  The slim profile of the tower also necessitated the use of visco-elastic dampers at the top to control wind and seismic motions.



• Following the construction of the Columbia Seafirst Tower (original name), public concern was raised about the potential for unchecked skyscraper development in Seattle and new measures were passed by the city in an effort to promote better development.  This project may likely remain the tallest in Seattle for  some time.



• A recent review of the tower's elevations revealed that, while the top of the penthouse is 1042.5' above sea level, the long-standing and much advertised height of 967' is incorrect.  The tower has two points of entry separated by a 50' difference in elevation.  At the main entry from 5th Avenue, the tower is 882'-6"" from the fourth floor Plaza to the top of the penthouse roof.  A second, less prominent entry permits access to the multi-level shopping arcade from 4th avenue and gives the tower a 932'-6"" height to the same point.  Likewise the tower can have either 73 or 76 floors depending on the point of reference used.

• The building is sheathed with Olympia white granite from a single quarry in Sardinia, Italy.



• 296 fluorescent fixtures light the dome at night.  It is also outlined in eight and a half inch wide, acrylic fiber-optic cables, with sixty watt bulbs at each end, along the sides.  The setbacks on the ninth, twenty-first, twenty-sixth and twenty-eighth floors are lighted using sixty-four one-thousand watt incandescent spotlights.  The lights require fifteen minutes to reach full brightness at the intended shade.

North Carolina's Tallest Building - 1928 to 1965



This building has won the most national design awards of any building in the southeast. It is recognized by many architects and preservationists as the best skyscraper in North Carolina. The building is a city symbol for Winston-Salem.



Notable National Architecture Awards

1929 AIA Building of the Year

1965 AIA Best Preserved Art Deco Building

1984 AIA Honor Award for Excellence in Design

1984 Art Deco Society of New York award winner for Best Restoration of an Art Deco Building

1991 Building Modernization Award



LED Lights on the building's crown can change colors and can be animated for different holidays or events.



The building's brass, marble walls, and carved wood ceilings, finished with gold and silver filament imported from Europe, is the work of the Rambusch Decorating Company. Rambusch Decorating Company was also the interior designer for the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in NYC.



The architects used designs for this building to create the Empire State Building's drawings in two weeks. In 1979, the Empire State Building sent a Happy 50th Anniversary Dad card to the Reynolds Building. This card is framed and on display in the lobby. This is the only building officially recognized as the father of the Empire State Building.



Purchased by Kimpton Hotels & Restaurants in May 2014, in partnership with PMC Property Group. The building was converted to a luxury boutique hotel and apartments at a cost of $60 million. The hotel opened April 27, 2016 with 210 hotel rooms, including 36 suites, a bar and a 120 seat restaurant. This is the only hotel in the world with a recreation center, featuring everything from bowling to indoor basketball. The building also has 117 luxury apartments with Kimpton hotel amenities.

The nation's first smart building; this was the first completely computer controlled office building. This skyscraper was also designed to be responsive to the differences in the sun's radiation and looks different from every angle it's viewed. The north facade is made of glass.  The windows in the southern facade are angled to keep the sun out. Windows in the east and west facades, which are exposed to harsh early and late day sun, are reduced in size and number.



Don Flow will renovate the building for his corporate headquarters and consolidate all of his company's office workers, from two states, in this one location. The building will also have a 35,000 square foot incubator for businesses started by area college students, to be called Winston Starts. The ground floor will have retail/restaurants. Flow would like for this skyscraper to become a tech commons for downtown Winston-Salem. Construction will begin in Spring 2017 and it will be completed in September 2017.

Originally built as Davis McCollum Department Store. It was the most upscale department store in North Carolina. Construction was completed on October 28, 1928. More than three thousand people crowded the streets at Fourth and Liberty to see it on opening day. Historian Fam Brownlee said ""Everybody had heard about this fabulous new place and they just wanted to see it. Everything upstairs was really upscale, it was aimed at the high end, but they put a lot of emphasis on the basement, the bargain basement. And it had terrific prospects. Who wouldn't have wanted to invest in it, with everything booming?"" The store changed ownership in 1929 and became Van Dyke's, named for one of the store's original partners who bought it. On November 2, 1939, the department store was replaced with Huntley Hill Stockton Furniture Store and in 1953 it became an office building. It has survived multiple demolition proposals, since the 1970s.



Restoration architect, David Gall said ""When it was built it was the tallest Art Deco building in the state.""



When restored as Hotel Indigo, the building will open with meeting space, a fitness center, The Sir Winston Steakhouse & Martini Bar on the lobby floor, and The Prince Albert Restaurant & Bar in the basement. Plans also include a possible expansion, to the west, to give the hotel 110 rooms.
